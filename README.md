# qProtect ASCII Art Transformer
Simply adds ASCII art to Java classes that are obfuscated using [qProtect](https://mdma.dev).

Inspired by [skidfuscator](https://github.com/skidfuscatordev/skidfuscator-java-obfuscator), I also stole their amogus ASCII art.

Currently, there is only the sus ASCII art, but I will add more soon.
